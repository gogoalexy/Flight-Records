### Analysis and Suggestions
1. Balanced propeller did reduce the vibration.

2. The crash in the second flight should come from malcontrol.
3. We should add a low battery alarm to notice the operater about the battery condition.
4. Connection between autopilot and the on-board computer is still unstable.
5. Only takeoff mode failed. Takeoff in Hold(Loiter) mode instead.
