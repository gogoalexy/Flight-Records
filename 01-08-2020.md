### Details
1. Flight1: The drone fliped.
2. Flight2: Arming check.
3. Flight3: The drone seems flew away and its rotors intertwined with the fishing line causing it crash.

### Analysis and Suggestions
1. When taking off, the flight mode should be switch to stabilized. In Altitude mode, the drone will flip over.

3. The baseline spinning speed of the motors is too high even after calibration. Thus, it is necessary to manually adjust the parameter PWM_MIN to a smaller value. The plots below show that the drone takeoff immediately after arming.

## Drone System Condition

### Hardware
| Autopilot | ESC    | Motor   | Propeller | Frame  | RC    | Battery |
| --------- | ------ | ------- | --------- | ------ | ----- | ------- |
| Good      | Good   | Good    | Good      | Good   | Good  | Good    |

### Software
* Manually adjust PWM_MIN from 1230 to 1050.

## Notes 
* Further validation of the baseline PWM output is required.
